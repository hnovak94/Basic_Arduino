# Not So Basic Arduino Assigments

New Ping + Hello Functions

## Hello Functions
This assignment I learned how to use a function. I used a continous servo and an ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino. Depending upon the distance away from an object (determined by the ultrasonic sensor), the servo would move a certain speed. The functions I used were called getDistance and microsecondsIntoCentimeters. getDistance figured out how far away an object was from the ultrasonic sensor. microsecondsIntoCentimeters converted the time it took for a wave to return to the ultrasonic sensor (in microseconds) to distance (in centimeters). 

### Problems + Advice
Looking at other students work on the CHS Sigma Wiki was helpful in understanding how to approach this assignment, because at first I wasn't sure what a function was supposed to do. The purpose of a function is to simplify and make your code more precise. It's a way to group parts of your code. This [link](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04/) was helpful in explaining how the ultrasonic sensor works and what the different parts of the code do.

## New Ping
This assignment I learned how to use new ping. I used a continous servo and an ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino. For my code, the servo would move at a continous pace until it reached a certain point (45cm), at which it would stop moving entirely. Using new ping eliminates the need for functions. 

### Problems + Advice
I didn't understand the point or use of new ping when I started the assignment and looking at former students work on the CHS Sigma Wiki was extremely helpful. Looking at the hello functions assignments and what code is required for the ultrasonic sensor versus what code you have for new ping (it's simplified to a line) can be helpful in understanding this assignment.
