## Not So Basic Arduino Assigments

NewPing + HelloFunction

## Hello Function
This assignment I learned how to use a function. I used a continous servo and an ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino. Depending upon the distance away from an object (determined by the ultrasonic sensor), the servo would move a certain speed. The functions I used were called getDistance and microsecondsIntoCentimeters. getDistance figured out how far away an object was from the ultrasonic sensor. microsecondsIntoCentimeters converted the time it took for a wave to return to the ultrasonic sensor (in microseconds) to distance (in centimeters).

### Problem/Advice
Looking at other students work on the CHS Sigma Wiki was helpful in understanding how to approach this assignment, because at first I wasn't sure what a function was supposed to do. Functions are really invaluable in coding, because they can really simplify your code, making it easier for others to read and understand.

## New Ping
This assignment I learned how to use new ping. I used a continous servo and an ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino. For my code, the servo would move at a continous pace until it reached a certain point (45cm), at which it would stop moving entirely. Using new ping eliminates the need for functions. 

### Problem/Advice
I didn't understand the point or use of new ping when I started the assignment and looking at former students work on the CHS Sigma Wiki was extremely helpful.
